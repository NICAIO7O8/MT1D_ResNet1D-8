## SA
This is a MATLAB program that uses SA inversion to solve the problem of one-dimensional inversion of geomagnetism.
## ResNet1D-18
This is the use of the original two-dimensional structure ResNet-18, modified to a one-dimensional structure to accommodate the one-dimensional inversion of geomagnetism.
## ResNet1D-8
The fully convolutional one-dimensional ResNet1D-8 network network is built by using the residual module.
## ResultCompar
Network models are compared in different ways.
